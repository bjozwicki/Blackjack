Blackjack is the American variant of a globally popular banking game known as Twenty-One.
It is a comparing card game between one or more players and a dealer,
where each player in turn competes against the dealer. 
Players do not compete against each other.

The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:
- Get 21 points on the player's first 2 cards (called a blackjack or natural), without a dealer blackjack;
- Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or
- Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21 (busted).

The cards are valued as follows:
- Ace can count as either 1 or 11.
- 2 through 9 are valued at their face value;
- 10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.

On their turn, players must choose whether to:
- "hit" (take a card),
- "stand" (end their turn),
- "double" (double wager, take a single card and finish),
- "split" (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands),
- or "surrender" (give up a half-bet and retire from the game)

After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts
or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace valued as 11, also known as a "soft 17",
must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others).
The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders.
If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win.
If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower.
